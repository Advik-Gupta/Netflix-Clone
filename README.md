A Netflix Clone I made using ReactJS, ReduxJS and Firebase. The app features full user authentication functionality and also uses React Router for routing.

Deployed App => https://netflix-clone-8c1f3.web.app/ (not responsive, i.e., open only on a computer)

PS - When you open the site you might get a warning from google saying the site is dangerous, thats because google thinks I am trying to impersonate Netlfix, which I am.
